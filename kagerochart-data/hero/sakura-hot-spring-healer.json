And I don't just mean physical injuries. A good soak can heal your soul, too. W-well, that's how I look at it, anyway... I always feel like I can give each day my very best as long as I know a hot spring is waiting at the end of it. So you be sure to take some time for yourself and have a good soak, too, OK?",
