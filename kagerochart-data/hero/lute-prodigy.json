I review this journal nightly. At first, I thought you may be a threat to my natural superiority, so I sought to discover your weaknesses. But as I continued to study you, my motives began to change. It was quite the odd phenomenon. Further observations are required for me to fully understand it, so I must continue my daily research. Please go about your business as usual.
