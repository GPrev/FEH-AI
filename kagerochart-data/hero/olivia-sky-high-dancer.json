Flying through the sky on his back for the first time was such a moving experience for me. The sound of cutting through the wind, the color of the sky, the brisk air all around me... I want to convey all of those things through my dancing! My hope is to give people who have never flown before a sense of how amazing it is. I've been trying a lot of new moves, but it isn't going as well as I had hoped. I've taken my fair share of tumbles lately... But when this new dance is finally ready, I want you to be the first person who sees it!",
