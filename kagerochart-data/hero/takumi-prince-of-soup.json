Oh, you'd like to learn more about Hoshidan New Year's traditions? Well, they're pretty involved, and explaining them thoroughly will likely take some time... But as long as you're OK with that, I'd be glad to tell you whatever you want to know. I can't say whether it's good fortune or bad, but there's no way of knowing if I'll ever be able to return home... So, for as long as I'm here, I'll continue to chat with you like this.
