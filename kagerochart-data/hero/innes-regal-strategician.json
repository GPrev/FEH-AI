I'll speak frankly. She is but a child. She lacks both my strength and my knowledge. What she has that I lack is innocence. People find it much easier to trust her than they do me. But there is no way for me to regain that purity of spirit. I know too much of the ways of the battlefield. Yet I have no choice but to find a way to become a man people can trust unreservedly. This is what I mean when I speak of the struggle for perfection... As a man who will be king, I must find a way. This may be difficult to comprehend, given our stations in life... Understand this. It is my way of making a pledge to you. I shall study with you, fight for you, and, yes, become the ideal monarch.",
