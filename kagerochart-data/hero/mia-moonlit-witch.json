That's why I like festivals like these. It doesn't matter whether you're a boy or girl, old or young. Everyone just accepts that you're here to have fun! Whether you're playing a trick, being tricked, or just eating candy, you can't help but smile through it all. Well, anyway, festivals like these don't happen everyday.
