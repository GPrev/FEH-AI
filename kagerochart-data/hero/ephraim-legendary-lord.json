The stronger I get, the more I want to fight. I'm driven to test myself. I know that's just how I am. But I also realize that this is not a healthy impulse for a king. People here call me a Legendary Hero, and sing my praises... They say that I am a good king, one who has vowed to protect his people. I will become king, one day. And though I am not yet that man, I hope to be. And I will protect my people... Not just them. My friend also hoped to save his people, and I will protect them, too...
